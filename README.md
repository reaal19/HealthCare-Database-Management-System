HealthCare Database Management System

Project Overview

This repository contains a database project designed and implemented as part of the Database System-1 course (IS211â€“ ISY211) at the Faculty of Computers and Information Technology, Future University in Egypt, during the Spring semester of 2023. The project is focused on a comprehensive healthcare management system that facilitates the management of patient records, medical appointments, prescriptions, and associated healthcare personnel data.

Project Purpose

The primary objectives of this project are to:

Enhance familiarity with database design and implementation.

Gain a solid understanding of database design procedures and relational integrity constraints.

Practice creating and manipulating databases using DDL and DML queries.

Develop a simple web application integrating the designed database.

Database Features

Tables: 6 tables minimum, each containing at least 5 attributes.

Data Records: At least 10 entries per table.

Relationships: Includes at least 6 relationships covering one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many types.

Special Attributes: Contains recursive, computed, multivalued, and composite attributes, as well as weak entities.

Constraints: Comprehensive implementation of constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Check, Not Null).
